        <p class="card-text">Being able to attend a live show of a band you love is something truly special. The
          atmosphere, the people, and even the loud music trying to burn a whole in your ear are just a few things that
          I like about it. My favorite bands right now are Greta Van Fleet and Palace. </p>

        <p class="card-text">Coding is something new in my life. I started January 2024 and currently it is 6 months
          later and I feel like I've gotten quite comfortable with front-end. My main goal is to become a full-stack dev
          and then become specialized in either field I enjoy more. </p>

          explore. </p>
